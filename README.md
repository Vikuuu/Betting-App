# Betting App ðŸŽ²

## Overview

The Betting App is a Django-based platform that allows users to register and participate in betting draws. The registration process is broken down into four distinct phases, each secured with access tokens to ensure that the same user completes all steps. The app uses JWT for authentication, providing a secure environment for users to engage in betting activities.

### Features

- User Registration in Four Phases:

  - Phase 1 - Mobile Number Registration: Users begin by registering their mobile number.
  - Phase 2 - OTP Verification: Users verify their mobile number via OTP (One-Time Password).
  - Phase 3 - Personal Details Submission: Users submit their personal details.
  - Phase 4 - User Activation: Final step to activate the user account.

- Access Token Management:

  - An access token is generated at each registration phase.
  - The token is required in the subsequent phase to ensure that the process is being completed by the same user.

- Custom Authentication Backend:

  - Utilizes JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure user authentication, implemented using the `pyJWT` library.
  - A custom authentication backend is created to handle mobile authentication.

- Betting Draw Participation:

  - Users can browse available draws to place bets.
  - After selecting a draw, users can enter the amount they wish to bet and choose their pick number.
